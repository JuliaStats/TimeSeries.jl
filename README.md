[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/TimeSeries.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/JuliaStats/TimeSeries.jl)

#### NOTICE of change to API

TimeSeries is in transition and will be removing dependency on the DataFrames/DataArrays data structures, at least for
the time being. A new time-based array type is planned, along with methods found in the current package implementation.

#### Installation

````julia
julia> Pkg.add("TimeSeries")
````

#### Documentation

Online documentation, including an API reference, is planned.
