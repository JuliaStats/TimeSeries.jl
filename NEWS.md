### 0.15.0

* New `TimeArray` constructor for creating a `TimeArray` from existing `TimeArray`.
  ([#380])

  ```julia
      TimeArray(ta::TimeArray; timestamp = ..., values = ..., colnames = ..., meta = ...)
  ```

  E.g.
  ```julia
  julia> meta(cl)
  "AAPL"

  julia> cl′ = TimeArray(cl; meta = :AAPL);

  julia> meta(cl′)
  :AAPL
  ```

### 0.14.0

* Symbol column indexing. ([#377])
  And the String indexing is deprecated.

  E.g.

  ```julia
  using MarketData
  ohlc[:Close]  # and cl["Close"] is deprecated
  ```

* `Base.getproperty` support. ([#377])
  All the columns can be accessed via the form `ta.column_name`.

  E.g.

  ```julia
  using MarketData
  ohlc.Open
  ```

  The original `TimeArray` fields getters is available as functions.

    * `timestamp(::TimeArray)`
    * `values(::TimeArray)`
    * `colnames(::TimeArray)`
    * `meta(::TimeArray)`

  ```julia
  ohlc.values  # this is unavailable due to Base.getproperty support
  values(ohlc)  # change to this
  ```

### 0.13.0

* Julia v0.7/1.0 support. ([#370])

[#370]: https://github.com/JuliaStats/TimeSeries.jl/pull/370


### 0.12.0

* Support `Base.copy(::TimeArray)`. ([#352])

* A new option for `TimeArray` constructor: `unchecked::Bool` to skip
  the sanity check of timestamp. ([#361])

  * `merge()` optimization via the `unchecked` option. ([#363])

* Revoking deprecation warning of `==` and redefining its meaning as
  'comparing all fields of two `TimeArray`s'.
  Note that if two `TimeArray`s have different dimension, we consider that is
  unequal.
  ([#356], [#357])

  ```julia
  julia> cl == copy(cl)
  true
  ```

  * Also, `isequal` and `hash` is supported now.

    ```julia
    julia> d = Dict(cl => 42);

    julia> d[cl]
    42

    julia> d[copy(cl)]
    42
    ```

* `diff` supports higher order difference now.([#350])

* `diff` support `n` time steps lag now. ([#362])

  ```julia
  julia> diff(cl, 5)
  495x1 TimeSeries.TimeArray{Float64,1,Date,Array{Float64,1}} 2000-01-10 to 2001-12-31

  ```

* New keyword argument for `readtimearray`: `header::Bool`. ([#358])

* `TimeArray` supports `all()` and `any()` now. ([#356], [#359])

  ```julia
  julia> ta
  3x2 TimeSeries.TimeArray{Int64,2,Date,Array{Int64,2}} 2000-01-03 to 2000-01-05

### 0.11.0

* Dropping 0.5 support. (issue [#327])

* `TimeArray` constructor, `merge`, `update`, `vcat` and `rename`
  will throw typed exceptions. (issue [#322])

* Signature of `moving` becomes

  ```julia
    moving(f, ta::TimeArray, window; padding=false)
  ```

  , in order to support do-syntax. The original one is deprecated. (issue [#334])

* Signature of `upto` becomes

  ```julia
    moving(f, ta::TimeArray, window; padding=false)
  ```

  , in order to support do-syntax. The original one is deprecated. (issue [#337])

* `map` supports callable object. (issue [#339])

  ```julia
  struct T end
  (::T)(timestamp, x) = (timestamp, x + 42)

  t = T()

  map(t, ta)
  ```

* `hcat` support. Given two `TimeArray` which have same timestamp,

  ```julia
    [ta1 ta2]
  ```

  can perform faster than ```merge(ta1, ta2)``` in this case.
  (issue [#341])

* Support more reduction functions of Base. (issue [#338])
    * `sum`
    * `mean`
    * `std`
    * `var`

  e.g.
  ```julia
    sum(ta)  # same as sum(ta, 1), and it's equivalent to moving(sum, ta, length(ta))
    sum(ta, 2)
  ```

* Support cumulative prod `cumprod`. (issue [#338])

* Support `eachindex(ta)`. (issue [#336])
